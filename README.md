# iPhone with only pure CSS and JS

The styling of the iphone was created using css only, the html strcture is created by a function that creates divs and appends them to the container div.

There are several properties in the function that allow the passage of a background image and several placement properties.

## Things to do next

 - Create a component that alllows the creation of the iPhone for a more dynamic approach
 - Create a custom iPhone emulated user Interface
